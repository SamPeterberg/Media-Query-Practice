# Media Query Practice

This repository contains a practice project for learning and implementing media queries using `div` elements. Media queries are a key component of responsive web design, allowing the layout of web pages to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.


## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to practice using media queries in CSS to create a responsive design. The project consists of several `div` elements that change their layout and styling based on the screen size.

## Description

This project demonstrates the use of media queries to build a responsive webpage. Media queries are essential for creating web pages that look good on both large screens (like desktops) and small screens (like smartphones). By using media queries, we can apply different styles depending on the screen size, ensuring that the layout adjusts seamlessly.

The project includes the following sections:
- **Header**: A simple header section to display the main title of the page.
- **Content**: The main content area that holds the primary information.
- **Sidebar**: An additional section for supplementary information or links.
- **Footer**: The footer area for page footer information.

The CSS includes media queries to adjust the layout:
- **Large screens**: The content and sidebar are displayed side by side.
- **Medium screens**: The content and sidebar stack vertically, but maintain full width.
- **Small screens**: All sections stack vertically and take up the full width of the screen.
